You have 20 blue balls and 13 red balls in a bag.<br>
You put your hand in and remove 2 at a time.<br>
If they’re of the same color, you add a blue ball to the bag.<br>
If they’re of different colors, you add a red ball to the bag.<br>
(Assume you have a big supply of blue & red balls for this purpose).<br>
Note: When you take the two balls out, you don’t put them back in, so the number of balls in the bag keeps decreasing.<br><br>

Question: What will be the color of the last ball left in the bag?<br>
Answer: Red
